# **Curriculum vitae**

1. Darya Enina
2. Phone/telegram/viber +375333317819. Github: @DaryaEnina
3. I'm new to IT, but I have a great desire to learn Front-end, get comfortable and move on. Purposefulness is my main strength: I don't know how to dream, I immediately set goals and make plans to achieve goals. Laziness is a weak side, but it is my engine of progress: I am too lazy to waste time, so I do everything quickly and efficiently. To do this, I constantly study, learn new things, come up with the best ways to solve problems.
4. I have no programming skills. At least for now.
5. Fullscreen:
   ```document.querySelector('.fullscreen').addEventListener('click', toggleScreen);
   function toggleScreen() {
   if (document.fullscreenElement === null) {
   document.documentElement.requestFullscreen();
   }
   else {
   if (document.fullscreenEnabled){
   document.exitFullscreen();
   }
   }
   };
   ```
6. I have no experience in programming.
7. I haven't received any education in programming.
8. English level: A2+. I can speak and understand, communicate in foreing coutries.
